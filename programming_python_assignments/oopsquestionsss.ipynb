    "# Module: OOP Assignments\n",
    "## Lesson: Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Encapsulation\n",
    "### Assignment 1: Polymorphism with Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a base class named `Shape` with a method `area`. Create two derived classes `Circle` and `Square` that override the `area` method. Create a list of `Shape` objects and call the `area` method on each object to demonstrate polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 2: Polymorphism with Function Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a function named `describe_shape` that takes a `Shape` object as an argument and calls its `area` method. Create objects of `Circle` and `Square` classes and pass them to the `describe_shape` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 3: Abstract Base Class with Abstract Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an abstract base class named `Vehicle` with an abstract method `start_engine`. Create derived classes `Car` and `Bike` that implement the `start_engine` method. Create objects of the derived classes and call the `start_engine` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 4: Abstract Base Class with Concrete Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `Vehicle` class, add a concrete method `fuel_type` that returns a generic fuel type. Override this method in `Car` and `Bike` classes to return specific fuel types. Create objects of the derived classes and call the `fuel_type` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 5: Encapsulation with Private Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a class named `BankAccount` with private attributes `account_number` and `balance`. Add methods to deposit and withdraw money, and to check the balance. Ensure that the balance cannot be accessed directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 6: Encapsulation with Property Decorators\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `BankAccount` class, use property decorators to get and set the `balance` attribute. Ensure that the balance cannot be set to a negative value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 7: Combining Encapsulation and Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a base class named `Person` with private attributes `name` and `age`. Add methods to get and set these attributes. Create a derived class named `Student` that adds an attribute `student_id`. Create an object of the `Student` class and test the encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 8: Polymorphism with Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a base class named `Animal` with a method `speak`. Create two derived classes `Dog` and `Cat` that override the `speak` method. Create a list of `Animal` objects and call the `speak` method on each object to demonstrate polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 9: Abstract Methods in Base Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an abstract base class named `Employee` with an abstract method `calculate_salary`. Create two derived classes `FullTimeEmployee` and `PartTimeEmployee` that implement the `calculate_salary` method. Create objects of the derived classes and call the `calculate_salary` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 10: Encapsulation in Data Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a data class named `Product` with private attributes `product_id`, `name`, and `price`. Add methods to get and set these attributes. Ensure that the price cannot be set to a negative value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 11: Polymorphism with Operator Overloading\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a class named `Vector` with attributes `x` and `y`. Overload the `+` operator to add two `Vector` objects. Create objects of the class and test the operator overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 12: Abstract Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an abstract base class named `Appliance` with an abstract property `power`. Create two derived classes `WashingMachine` and `Refrigerator` that implement the `power` property. Create objects of the derived classes and access the `power` property.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 13: Encapsulation in Class Hierarchies\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a base class named `Account` with private attributes `account_number` and `balance`. Add methods to get and set these attributes. Create a derived class named `SavingsAccount` that adds an attribute `interest_rate`. Create an object of the `SavingsAccount` class and test the encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 14: Polymorphism with Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a class named `Flyer` with a method `fly`. Create a class named `Swimmer` with a method `swim`. Create a class named `Superhero` that inherits from both `Flyer` and `Swimmer` and overrides both methods. Create an object of the `Superhero` class and call both methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 15: Abstract Methods and Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an abstract base class named `Worker` with an abstract method `work`. Create two derived classes `Engineer` and `Doctor` that implement the `work` method. Create another derived class `Scientist` that inherits from both `Engineer` and `Doctor`. Create an object of the `Scientist` class and call the `work` method."
